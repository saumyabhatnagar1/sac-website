  So that creativity follows right behind logic, symmentry and expression. Indradhanush is a cultural club of the institute \
  and is behind the beautiful artistic work behind every event. This club works on the power of imagination and visualisation \
  which is a strong primary requirement even while working with codes. The club recognises the need of human to express ideas to upgrade living standards. \
  In a technical institute like ours we aim at bringing out the hidden artists in IIITNR. We bring together all forms of art- digital art, \
  canvas painting, pencil art, mandala art, pen art, doodling and the list goes on. We're also a bridge that connects art to craft. \
  To name a few craft work that artists in the club practice are quilling, origami and handicraft.";
